The Tic Tac Toe game code follows these steps:

1. Import the necessary random module for the computer's moves.

2. The game board is represented using a list called `board` with 9 elements, initially filled with empty spaces.

3. The print_board() function displays the current state of the board, printing the rows and adding a line separator.

4. The check_win(player) function checks if the specified player ("X" or "O") has won the game by analyzing rows, columns, and diagonals. It returns True if a win condition is found, otherwise False.

5. The player_turn() function handles the player's turn. It prompts the player to enter a position (1-9) on the board. If valid and empty, the player's marker ("X") is placed, and it checks for a win. If the player wins, it displays a congratulatory message and returns True. If the move is invalid, an error message is shown, and the function calls itself again.

6. The computer_turn() function handles the computer's turn. It generates a list of available positions on the board, selects a random position, and places the computer's marker ("O"). It then checks for a win by the computer. If the computer wins, it displays a message and returns True.

7. The play_game() function manages the game flow. It initializes game_over to False and alternates between the player's and computer's turns until one of these conditions is met:
   - The player wins (player_turn() returns True).
   - The computer wins (computer_turn() returns True).
   - The game ends in a tie (all board positions are filled).

8. Finally, the play_game() function is called to start the game.

This implementation allows a single player to play against the computer. Players and the computer take turns making moves until there is a winner or a tie. The board is displayed after each move, and the game outcome is announced at the end.

Feel free to customize and expand upon this code to add additional features, improve the AI of the computer player, or enhance the user experience.
